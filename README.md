## Note the upcoming [Concurrent Python Developer Retreat](http://mindviewinc.com/ConcurrentPythonDeveloperRetreat.html) Featuring Luciano Ramalho, July 16-19 2017 in Crested Butte, Colorado
# ConcurrentPython
An intermediate-to-advanced book on Python concurrency

> This is a work in progress. It is being created in the open in order to produce feedback and
> ultimately make it as accurate as possible.

* The ebook version will remain free, although I haven't yet decided on the specific license.

* This book is written using [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)-flavored Markdown. Thus, although you can read the chapters
  directly in the `Chapters` subdirectory of this repository, you will see various artifacts from Pandoc's Markdown
  extensions that don't render via Github Markdown. These are typically minor issues and don't greatly impact readability.
  
* The epub build system is not yet in place.
